###  Step-by-step documentation on how to do the following:
#### 1. Prepare and Install Headless Raspbian OS in Raspberry Pi
* Step 1: Download Raspbian OS. Head over to (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and download the latest version of Raspbian OS (now called Raspberry Pi OS).
* Step 2: Insert your SD card into your computer and launch Raspberry Pi Imager. Select the "Choose OS" option and navigate to the downloaded Raspbian image file. Choose the SD card and click "Write." This will format the SD card and flash the Raspbian image onto it.
* Step 3: Enable SSH (Headless Setup). Create an empty file named ssh (without any extension) in the root directory of the microSD card. This enables SSH on the Raspberry Pi.
* Step 4: Configure Wi-Fi (Optional).
* Step 5: Insert the MicroSD Card. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.

#### 2. Connecting to Raspberry Pi via SSH using the terminal
#### 3. Deploying LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) Stack in raspberry Pi
#### 4. Enabling and controlling Raspberry Pi using VNC
